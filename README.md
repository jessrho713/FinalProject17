Final Project for Programming \n
The player is trapped in a dragon's lair, and they were caught trying to steal some of the dragon's hoarded gold. The dragon wakes up and considers eating the player, but instead decides to entertain itself by asking the player riddles. This game is set up so the player has to choose the letter of the answer to the riddle. Choosing four right answers makes the player win, but choosing 3 wrong ones makes the player lose.

Some sources I used:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
    this source helped me understand how to use the random generation.
  https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects
    this source helped me to refresh on classes and objects, and to gain a better understanding of how to use them.
  http://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/
    this source was a huge help in making my game fun with a spash of color.

Final Project for Programming
 
The player is trapped in a dragon's lair, and they were caught trying to steal some of the dragon's hoarded gold. The dragon wakes up and considers eating the player, but instead decides to entertain itself by asking the player riddles. This game is set up so the player has to choose the letter of the answer to the riddle. Choosing the right answer makes the player win, but choosing the wrong one makes the player lose. 

Some sources I used:

  https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

    this source helped me understand how to use the random generation.

  https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects

    this source helped me to refresh on classes and objects, and to gain a better understanding of how to use them.

  http://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/

    this source was a huge help in making my game fun with a spash of color.

http...(Who am I kidding) My wonderful friends!

    these sources helped the most by giving me riddle ideas and helping me to check my code :>
